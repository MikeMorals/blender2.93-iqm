# blender2.93-iqm

iqm importer by Tor Anderson
iqm exporter by Lee Salzman

to export models, select all wanted meshes and armatures and in the export options type in the action you want exported

I fixed a bug with the importer that would happen when you tried to load any iqm model, it would load the skeleton without animation then error at the model.
 currently both plugins work with blender 2.8+
